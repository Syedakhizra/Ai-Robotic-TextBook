# Module 2: Gazebo / Unity Digital Twin

This module delves into the world of robotics simulation, focusing on the creation and utilization of digital twins using Gazebo and Unity. Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems, offering a safe, cost-effective, and efficient environment for developing, testing, and refining robotic algorithms before deploying them to real hardware.

## Module Objectives

Upon completion of this module, you will be able to:

*   Set up and configure both Gazebo and Unity for robotics simulation.
*   Model robot sensors (e.g., LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) within simulation environments.
*   Understand the conversion and interoperability between URDF and SDF formats for robot models.
*   Implement basic human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios within a Unity simulation environment.
*   Develop and test ROS 2 applications in a simulated environment.

## Prerequisites

To make the most of this module, you should have:

*   A solid understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals (as covered in Module 1).
*   Basic familiarity with 3D concepts and coordinate systems.
*   A working installation of Gazebo, Unity 2022.3 LTS, and associated tools as per the [Installation Guides](../appendices/install-guides.md).
