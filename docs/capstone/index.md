# Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

This capstone project serves as the culmination of your learning journey through the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook." It challenges you to integrate all the concepts, tools, and techniques learned across Modules 1-4 into a comprehensive system for an autonomous humanoid robot. The goal is to develop a voice-to-perception-to-motion pipeline that enables the robot to understand and execute high-level commands in a simulated environment.

## Project Objectives

Upon successful completion of this capstone project, you will be able to:

*   **Integrate ROS 2 Components**: Seamlessly connect nodes, topics, services, and actions for a complex robotic application.
*   **Utilize Simulation Environments**: Effectively use Gazebo, Unity, or NVIDIA Isaac Sim to test and validate your humanoid robot's capabilities.
*   **Implement Perception Pipelines**: Develop or integrate object detection and pose estimation systems to provide the robot with environmental awareness.
*   **Apply Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Principles**: Create a functional pipeline that translates natural language commands into robot behaviors.
*   **Plan and Execute Motions**: Use motion planning tools (e.g., MoveIt 2 conceptual) to generate safe and efficient robot movements.
*   **Evaluate System Performance**: Assess the overall system's functionality, robustness, and adherence to safety principles against a defined rubric.

## Scenario

You will simulate an autonomous humanoid robot in a household or laboratory environment. The robot receives high-level voice commands (e.g., "Please pick up the blue cup from the table and hand it to me," "Go clean the workbench"). Your task is to implement the underlying AI and robotics software stack that allows the robot to parse these commands, identify target objects, navigate, manipulate, and provide feedback.

## Key Integration Points

This project will require you to bring together:

*   **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: For inter-component communication and system orchestration.
*   **Digital Twin Simulation**: To create a realistic testing ground for your humanoid.
*   **NVIDIA Isaac AI Stack**: Potentially for accelerated perception or realistic simulation.
*   **Vision-Language-Action**: The core pipeline for intelligent command execution.

This capstone is designed to be challenging yet rewarding, providing you with hands-on experience in building a truly autonomous and intelligent robotic system. Good luck!
