# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module explores the cutting-edge field of **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models in robotics. VLA models aim to bridge the gap between human intent (expressed through natural language), robot perception (vision), and physical interaction (action). This allows robots to understand and execute complex commands given in human language, leading to more intuitive and versatile human-robot collaboration.

## Module Objectives

Upon completion of this module, you will be able to:

*   Understand the principles of Vision-Language-Action models in robotics.
*   Utilize voice-to-text models (like Whisper) to convert speech into robot commands.
*   Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level task planning and command interpretation.
*   Integrate perception and motion planning pipelines for physical robot execution.
*   Understand how to integrate VLA systems within the ROS 2 framework.
*   Recognize and implement safety rules for robust and reliable human-robot collaboration.

## Prerequisites

To make the most of this module, you should have:

*   A solid understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals (as covered in Module 1).
*   Familiarity with robotics simulation concepts (as covered in Module 2).
*   Basic understanding of AI/Machine Learning, especially computer vision and natural language processing concepts.
*   Access to a capable development PC for running LLMs and simulations.
