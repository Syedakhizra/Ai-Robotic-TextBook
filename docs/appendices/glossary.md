# Glossary of Key Terms

This glossary provides definitions for important terms used throughout the textbook. Terms will be added and defined as content is developed.

## A
*   **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

## B
*   **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: An open-source, meta-operating system for robots that provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications.

## C
*   **Docusaurus**: A static site generator that helps you build optimized websites quickly, often used for documentation sites.

## D
*   **Digital Twin**: A virtual model of a physical object or system. In robotics, it allows for simulation and testing without physical hardware.

## E
*   **Embodied AI**: Artificial intelligence that is physically instantiated and interacts with the real world through sensors and actuators.

## G
*   **Gazebo**: A powerful 3D robot simulator that is widely used in the ROS community.

## I
*   **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)**: A professional association for electronic engineering and electrical engineering. Its standards are widely used in technical documentation.
*   **Isaac Sim**: An NVIDIA Omniverse-based scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool.

## J
*   **Jetson Orin**: NVIDIA's family of power-efficient, AI-enabled embedded computing modules designed for robotics and edge AI applications.

## L
*   **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth.

## M
*   **Mermaid**: A Markdown-inspired syntax that allows you to create diagrams and flowcharts using text.

## R
*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: An AI framework that optimizes the output of a large language model with targeted information from an authoritative knowledge base. (Note: This textbook explicitly avoids RAG features for content generation but may be mentioned contextually).
*   **rclpy**: The Python client library for ROS 2.

## S
*   **SDF (Simulation Description Format)**: An XML format for describing objects and environments for robot simulators, especially Gazebo.

## T
*   **TypeScript**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to plain JavaScript.

## U
*   **Ubuntu**: A popular Linux distribution widely used in robotics development.
*   **Unity**: A cross-platform game engine that can also be used for advanced robotics simulation and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).
*   **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for describing all elements of a robot. It is commonly used in ROS.

## V
*   **VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: An emerging field in AI robotics that integrates computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action planning.
