# IEEE Citation Style Guidelines

This appendix provides guidelines for applying the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) citation style throughout the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook." Consistent citation ensures academic rigor, proper attribution, and technical accuracy.

## 1. General Principles

*   **Numbered Citations**: Sources are cited in the text by a number in square brackets, e.g., \[1], \[2], \[3]–\[5].
*   **Sequential Numbering**: Citations are numbered sequentially in their order of appearance in the text.
*   **Reuse Numbers**: Once a source has been cited, the same number is used for all subsequent citations of that source.
*   **Reference List**: A comprehensive list of references, ordered numerically, appears at the end of the document.

## 2. In-Text Citations

*   **Direct Mention**:
    *   "As stated by Smith \[1]..."
    *   "...the algorithm was improved \[2]."
*   **Multiple Citations**: List each citation number separately with a comma or use a range if consecutive:
    *   "...several studies \[3], \[6], \[9] have shown..."
    *   "...recent research \[10]–\[12] confirms..."
*   **Avoid Attributing to Citation**: Do not use the author's name in the text if only referring to the source. "\[1] states..." is incorrect. Use "\[1] proposes..." or "As discussed in \[1]..."
*   **Placement**: Place the citation numbers immediately after the information it supports, before any punctuation, or at the end of the sentence.

## 3. Reference List Examples

The reference list should be a separate section at the end of the document, titled "References," and ordered numerically.

## 4. Tools and Practices

*   **Reference Manager**: Authors are encouraged to use a reference management tool (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley) to maintain and generate citations in IEEE format.
*   **Manual Verification**: During the review process, citations will be manually checked for adherence to these guidelines.
*   **Consistency**: Ensure consistent application of the IEEE style throughout the entire textbook.
