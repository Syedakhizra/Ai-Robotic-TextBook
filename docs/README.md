# AI Robotics Textbook Documentation

This directory contains the Markdown source files for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook.

Each module of the textbook resides in its own subdirectory (e.g., `module-1/`, `module-2/`, etc.), along with an `appendices/` directory for supplementary material.

The structure is configured via `sidebars.ts` to provide clear navigation through the book's content.
