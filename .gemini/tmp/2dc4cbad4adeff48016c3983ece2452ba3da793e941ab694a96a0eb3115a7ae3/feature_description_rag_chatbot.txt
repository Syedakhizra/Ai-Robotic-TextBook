Create a detailed specification for Phase 2 of my project: integrating a RAG-based chatbot into my Docusaurus book. Requirements: - The chatbot must answer questions ONLY from the book content or user-selected text. - Use FastAPI backend, OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, Neon Serverless Postgres, and Qdrant Cloud Free Tier. - Include: system architecture, data flow, chunking strategy, embedding model choice, API endpoints, vector database schema, and UI integration plan. - Keep all book modules unchanged. - Match updated Constitution standards. Deliverables: 1. Architecture diagram + backend components 2. Data ingestion & embeddings pipeline specification 3. Retrieval + ranking method 4. FastAPI routes for: ingest, query, debugging, health-check 5. Chatbot frontend (React widget) integration details for Docusaurus 6. Deployment steps for GitHub Pages + backend hosting 7. Security, rate limits, and environment variable handling 8. Testing criteria for accuracy and hallucination reduction Write the specification clearly, structured, and actionable.
