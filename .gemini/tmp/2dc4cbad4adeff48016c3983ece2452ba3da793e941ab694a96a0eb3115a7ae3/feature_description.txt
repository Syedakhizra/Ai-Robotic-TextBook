Feature: Recreate & Improve Docusaurus Landing Page UI
Goal: Rebuild the book landing page UI that was broken during backend setup, without touching existing modules/content pages.
Scope:
- Recreate homepage (index.tsx / index.md) only
- Do NOT modify module pages or sidebar structure
UI Requirements:
- Modern AI/Robotics-themed landing page
- Professional, startup-quality design (not default Docusaurus look)
- Consistent color palette (dark + accent colors suitable for AI/robotics)
- Proper spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
Header / Hero Section:
- Large hero section with background image or illustration (AI + humanoid robots)
- Clear title, subtitle, and short tagline
- Primary CTA button (e.g. “Start Learning”)
- Optional secondary CTA (e.g. “View Modules”)
Navbar:
- Fix logo visibility (logo must appear correctly on all themes)
- Ensure navbar styling matches landing page theme
- Do NOT break existing navigation links
Sections to Include:
- Key Features (clean cards, icons/images, better layout)
- Course Overview (short + visual)
- Modules Overview (reuse existing module data, no content change)
- Call-to-Action section at bottom
Images & Media:
- Use high-quality AI/robotics images (no boring placeholders)
- Optimize images for web
- Do not hotlink external images directly
Animations:
- Add subtle animations (on scroll / hover)
- Use a lightweight animation library compatible with Docusaurus (e.g. Framer Motion)
- Animations should enhance UX, not distract
Constraints:
- No backend changes
- No module content changes
- No breaking existing routes
- Must work in both light & dark mode
Success Criteria:
- Visually appealing, modern landing page
- Logo visible and correct in navbar
- Animations working smoothly
- Homepage clearly communicates book value and professionalism
