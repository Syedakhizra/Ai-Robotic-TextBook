# Research Plan: Modern Landing Page UI Redesign

## Research Tasks

1.  **Task**: Investigate best practices for integrating GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) with React and Docusaurus for smooth, futuristic animations.
    *   Focus on `gsap.from()` and `gsap.to()` for fade-in, slide-up, and zoom effects.
    *   Explore GSAP's `ScrollTrigger` for animations on scroll.
    *   Find efficient ways to manage GSAP tweens in React components.

2.  **Task**: Source high-quality, free-to-use AI and robotics-themed images and illustrations that match the requested futuristic and modern aesthetic (light, holographic, neon).
    *   Explore platforms like Unsplash, Pexels, and Pixabay.
    *   Look for images with a blue, black, white color palette.

3.  **Task**: Analyze UX patterns for modern documentation landing pages.
    *   Identify common layouts, call-to-action placements, and visual hierarchies.
    *   Review high-end tech product websites for inspiration on spacing, typography, and card design.

## Research Findings

### 1. GSAP Integration

*   **Decision**: [NEEDS RESEARCH]
*   **Rationale**: [NEEDS RESEARCH]
*   **Alternatives considered**: Framer Motion (as suggested in the prompt), CSS keyframes (for simpler animations). GSAP is chosen for its power and fine-grained control.

### 2. Image Sourcing

*   **Decision**: [NEEDS RESEARCH]
*   **Rationale**: [NEEDS RESEARCH]
*   **Alternatives considered**: Using paid stock photos, creating custom illustrations (out of scope for this task).

### 3. UX Patterns

*   **Decision**: [NEEDS RESEARCH]
*   **Rationale**: [NEEDS RESEARCH]
*   **Alternatives considered**: Sticking to a more traditional documentation layout (which the user found "boring").
