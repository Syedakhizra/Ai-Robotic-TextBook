# Research Plan: AI Robotics Textbook

## Research Approach

The research process will be concurrent with the writing phase to ensure the most up-to-date and relevant information is integrated into the textbook. This involves a continuous cycle of identification, evaluation, and synthesis of sources.

1.  **Identify Research Needs**: As each section or concept is drafted, identify specific knowledge gaps or areas requiring deeper validation (e.g., new ROS 2 features, Isaac Sim updates, academic papers on VLA models).
2.  **Source Gathering**: Prioritize official documentation (ROS 2, NVIDIA, Unity), academic papers (IEEE Xplore, arXiv), and reputable community resources (robotics forums, GitHub repositories). Keywords will be derived directly from the content being written.
3.  **Critical Evaluation**: For each source, verify its authority, currency, and relevance. Cross-reference information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy and consensus within the robotics community.
4.  **Synthesize and Integrate**: Incorporate validated research findings directly into the draft content. Update existing explanations, add new insights, and refine technical details.
5.  **Citation Management**: Maintain a rigorous citation process using IEEE style, adding references as sources are integrated.
6.  **Regular Review**: Periodically review the research plan and methodology, adapting to emerging technologies or changes in best practices.

This concurrent approach ensures that the textbook remains current and technically accurate throughout its development lifecycle.
