# Data Model: Frontend UI/UX Refinement for Docusaurus Site

**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: In Progress

This feature is primarily concerned with styling and layout, not with data structures. Therefore, there is no specific data model to define for this frontend UI/UX refinement.

The existing data models for chatbot messages (`Message` interface in `ChatbotWidget.tsx`) and FastAPI communication (`ChatRequest`, `ChatResponse` in `backend/models.py`) remain unchanged as per the feature constraints.
